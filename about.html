      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="aboutMeOverview">I am a Denver based UX/UI designer who is passionate about designing
        for change. Ask those closest to me and they will tell you that I care
        deeply about a lot of different issues including, but not limited to
        environmental justice, social justice, and women’s issues. They will
        also tell you that I am genuinely self-reflective and always striving
        to improve myself and my work.  I love food, friends, nature, and playing
        the ukelele. I also love taking pictures of nature and I took all
        the photos on this page!</p>

      <h2>My Roots</h2>
      <p>I am a former science educator that found design completely by accident
         and then realized it was what I had been working towards all along. Before
         I get into that part of the story though, let me tell you a bit more about
         my roots. I grew up the daughter of a marine biologist and community nurse.
         Both incredibly passionate about the way in which they were contributing
         to the world around them. The combination of traveling the world to go
         out into the field with my dad and the non-stop playlist of NPR shows
         gave me the privilege of learning about the world and all the different
         kinds of people that live in it.</p>

      <h2>From Teaching to Designing</h2>
      <p>I decided to become a teacher and stayed on this track all throughout
          my education at the College of Education at the University of Maryland.
          As a graduate student, I narrowed my focus on climate change science
          curriculum and instruction. I was lucky enough to work on designing
          curriculum on this very topic with some of the most progressive minds
          in the field. Teaching encompassed some of my greatest strengths: building
          connections and relationships through empathy and listening, crafting
          research driven curriculum which I constantly iterated upon through testing
          in the field (my classroom), and being creative and thinking on my feet
          when something didn’t go as planned (which was pretty much everyday).
          Though my experience in education was invaluable and fulfilling, there
          were aspects that caused me to question the sustainability of it for me
          as a career. I felt an itch to explore what else I could be a part of.</p>
      <p>As I alluded to before, I was introduced to the field of UX/ UI
          completely by accident and during a time when I was really unsure of
          where my future was going. In searching for new inspiration,  I stumbled
          upon the UX/UI community in my city and, to my delight, found other
          former educators who had made the transition. From there, everything
          started falling into place.</p>

    <!-- Designing all along-->
    <section id="designingAlong">
      <h2>Designing All Along</h2>
      <p>As I dove into the world of UX/UI design, I started to realize just
          how many times I had wanted to be a designer before. For example, a
          design problem I once experienced happened when I was writing the
          curriculum for my sixth grade class and was struggling to find resources
          accessible for young students. I started to dream of being able to design
          my own resources from websites that tracked climatic shifts to websites
          that connected kids across the world to share their stories of how climate
          change was impacting their communities. I didn’t realize at the time that
          I was already starting my passion for UX/ UI design through my desire to
          create platforms that could inform teachers, young students, and even
          everyday citizens about these issues. I started to create a hybrid
          curriculum using what was helpful from various outside sources as well
          as my own curriculums that I had created in the past. I didn’t realize
          it at the time but I was already conducting user research and even usability
          tests with, not only my students, but also other teachers that I was
          sharing my work with and asking them about how I could improve it.</p>

    <!-- Social impact and design section -->
    <section id="socialImpact">
      <h2>Social Impact & Design</h2>
      <p>It seems to me that design can be a powerful force in informing people
          and improving people’s lives as well as giving them new opportunities:
          this is the kind of work I would like to be a part. I believe designers
          have a responsibility  to think about the voiceless, marginalized, and
          underrepresented people in the world and make sure they get a voice
          through design. This is the work I have done as an educator and environmentalist.
          I would like to use design to influence the future by changing the narrative
          of who is represented, how they are represented, and whether or not resources
          are accessible to them; or in other words, I would like to be a
          socially responsible designer.</p>
