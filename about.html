      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="aboutMeMainText">I am a Denver based UX/UI designer who is passionate about designing
        for change. Ask those closest to me and they will tell you that I care
        deeply about a lot of different issues including, but not limited to
        environmental justice, social justice, and women’s issues. They will
        also tell you that I am genuinely self-reflective and always striving
        to improve myself and my work.  I love food, friends, nature, and playing
        the ukelele. I also love taking pictures of nature and I took all
        the photos on this page!</p>

          <p class="sectionText sectionGrey">I am a former science educator that found design completely by accident
             and then realized it was what I had been working towards all along. Before
             I get into that part of the story though, let me tell you a bit more about
             my roots. I grew up the daughter of a marine biologist and community nurse.
             Both incredibly passionate about the way in which they were contributing
             to the world around them. The combination of traveling the world to go
             out into the field with my dad and the non-stop playlist of NPR shows
             gave me the privilege of learning about the world and all the different
             kinds of people that live in it.</p>

      <h3 class="moveOver">From Teaching to Designing</h3>
      <p class="sectionText sectionWhite">I decided to become a teacher and go to the University of Maryland.
          As a graduate student, I narrowed my focus on climate change science
          curriculum and instruction. I was lucky enough to work on designing
          curriculum on this very topic with some of the most progressive minds
          in the field. Teaching encompassed some of my greatest strengths: building
          connections and relationships through empathy and listening, crafting
          research driven curriculum which I constantly iterated upon through testing
          in the field (my classroom), and being creative and thinking on my feet
          when something doesn't go as planned (which was pretty much everyday).
          Though my experience in education was invaluable, there
          were aspects that caused me to question the sustainability of it for me
          as a career. I felt an itch to explore what else I could be a part of.
        <br>
        <br>I was introduced to the field of UX/ UI during a time when I was really unsure of
          where my future was going. In searching for new inspiration,  I stumbled
          upon the UX/UI community in my city and, to my delight, found other
          former educators who had made the transition. From there, everything
          started falling into place.</p>

      <div class="greyBoxes">
        <div class="greyBox1">
          <h3 class="moveright">Designing All Along</h3>
          <p class="sectionText sectionGrey">As I dove into the world of UX/UI design, I started to realize just
              how many times I had wanted to be a designer before. For example, a
              design problem I once experienced happened when I was writing the
              curriculum for my sixth grade class and was struggling to find resources
              accessible for young students. I started to dream of being able to design
              my own resources from websites that tracked climatic shifts to websites
              that connected kids across the world to share their stories of how climate
              change was impacting their communities. I didn’t realize at the time that
              I was already starting my passion for UX/ UI design through my desire to
              create platforms that could inform teachers, young students, and even
              everyday citizens about these issues. I started to create a hybrid
              curriculum using what was helpful from various outside sources as well
              as my own curriculums that I had created in the past. I didn’t realize
              it at the time but I was already conducting user research and even usability
              tests with, not only my students, but also other teachers that I was
              sharing my work with and asking them about how I could improve it.</p>

          <h3 class="moveOver">Social Impact & Design</h3>
          <p class="sectionText sectionWhite">It seems to me that design can be a powerful force in informing people
              and improving people’s lives as well as giving them new opportunities:
              this is the kind of work I would like to be a part of. I believe designers
              have a responsibility  to think about the voiceless, marginalized, and
              underrepresented people in the world and make sure they get a voice
              through design. This is the work I have done as an educator and environmentalist.
              I would like to use design to influence the future by changing the narrative
              of who is represented, how they are represented, and whether or not resources
              are accessible to them; or in other words, I would like to be a
              socially responsible designer.</p>
