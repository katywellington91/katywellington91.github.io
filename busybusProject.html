    <section class="overview">
      <h2>Overview & Design Problem</h2>
        <p class="projectSubtitle">The scenario for this application is a large city transit system that
           recently underwent an expansion. This expansion has led to the addition
           of many new bus routes. While expansions can definitely lead to
           benefits, they can also lead to added complexity for the users. In
           this case, users were specifically complaining about stops that serve
           multiple bus lines.</p>
        <p class="projectSubtitle">Picture this for a second: You are a user of this public transit
          system. You are walking towards your regular bus stop from which you
          commute to work. You are about a block away when you see a bus pull up.
          You hold your bag tight and run to the bus stop only to find out that… it is not your bus.
          This situation can be easily avoided with a mobile app that reliably and
          accurately gives the users information about the bus stops in this
          city transit system.</p>
        <p class="projectSubtitle">Questions addressed by the app:</p>
        <p class="projectSubtitle">Which bus line is arriving next?</p>
        <p class="projectSubtitle">When will it arrive?</p>
        <p class="projectSubtitle">How long does the user have to get to that stop?</p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <div>
        <p class="projectSubtitle">Public transit application are an integral part of the public transit
          system today. BusyBus allows users to more efficiently plan, not only
          their transit journeys, but their whole days by removing the ambiguity
          and confusion of when buses will arrive and at which bus stop locations.
          Users can look at specific stops and find out how long it will take them
          to get to that stop and which buses will be arriving there at specific times.</p>

    <section class="userResearch">
      <h5>User Research | Getting to Know the Users</h5>
      <div class= "researchBoxes">
        <div class="researchBox1">
        <p class="secSub">I started by conducting both user surveys and user interviews. My user
          survey was completed by over 30 participants from all over the world.
          The survey asked them questions about their public transportation usage,
          their current and preferred ways to navigate their public transit systems,
          the applications they use (if any), and their preferences and usage of
          these apps as well as their pain points.I also chose 2 participants
          from the survey to interview.<br>
        <br>From the survey and interviews, I discovered that 70% of users feel
          that the most important feature on a public transit app is access to s
          chedule and times, 67% of users feel that there are aspects of inaccuracy
          in the current apps they use,  and 65% of users feel that their apps are
          in some way not user friendly.<br>
        <br>My most surprising discovery was that many people, though they may want
          to try a locally or regionally specific application, many switch to Google
          apps because other apps externalize information in the sense that different
          features have to be viewed in a different window, on a different website,
          or even in a completely different application.</p>

    <section class="competitiveAnalysis">
      <h5>Competitive Analysis | Market Scope</h5>

      <div class= "researchBoxes">
        <div class="researchBox1">
          <p class="secSub">In order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of other public
            transit apps as well as find the market opportunity for my BusyBus app,
            I completed a SWOT competitive analysis of Google Maps and RTD Denver.
            From the SWOT analysis, I found...<br>
          <br>The RTD app provides system maps and station information specific to
            Denver that Google Maps does not provide. However, this app’s weaknesses
            include an interface that is busy and confusing to navigate. RTD Denver
            also often provides inaccurate schedule and time information.<br>
          <br>Google Maps is globally known as a reliable navigation app for multiple
            modes of transportation including cars, buses, bikes, walking etc.  Google
            maps is also known for its accuracy and reliability in terms of journey
            times and distances. However, the weakness of Google Maps in this situation
            is that it does not provide bus stop specific information which is what
            was specifically asked for by users in this case study design brief.<br>
          <br>I discovered that the opportunity for my BusyBus app would be a locally
            specific, reliable and accurate transit app where users can find everything
            they need in one app. The BusyBus user interface would also need to be
            easy to be intuitive and easy to use in order to stay competitive in the
            category of transit applications.</p>

              events in the city and thinks that it is easier to get into the city than
              by car because he does not have to worry about traffic or parking. He
              also uses public transit to get to the airport which he has to do often

          items chosen and new pages. I kept my color palette consistent throughout
          the different screens from the button colors, information colors, and
          background colors. I also made sure to avoid using colors that make it
          hard for people to perceive the content.
        <br>
        <br>Finally, I made sure, using the Contrast app from Apple, that my
          contrast ratios received an AA or AAA rating so that my app would provide
          optimal legibility for all users.</p>

          Interface Guidelines. I stuck to SF Pro Text or SF Pro Display for any
          text within my prototype. I used these fonts because the interface
          guidelines discussed how they can be used in a flexible manner at different
          sizes and weights while still maintaining legibility. I also used
          different sizes and weights to establish hierarchy of information.
          For example, I used font size 20 and bold style for titles. I also
          minimized the number of typefaces I used as per recommendation
          by the guidelines</p>

        participants of the usability tests, I created clear labels for the back
        buttons, and made sure that the map design was created in a way that
        clearly showed interactive aspects. This was done by placing familiar
        icons such as location icons. In creating this clickable prototype I also
        followed the iOS Human Interface Guidelines to maintain consistency

        <div class="researchBoxes">
          <div class="researchBox1">
            <p class="finalSubtitle">My final step in creating this application was to code the final
              prototype. I used my knowledge of HTML and CSS to create the third screen
              of the visual prototype which lists the busses that arrive at a
              specific bus stop.
            <br>
            <br>For this final prototype, I was given more information that I needed
              to account for that I did not plan for in my original hi-fidelity
              mock-up design such as direction of travel, busses that were rerouted,
              and busses that were out of service. I made decisions in the creation
              of this final prototype so that it would maintain consistency with the
              visual design and the iOS human interface guidelines in terms of features
              such as space, typography, hierarchy, and color choice.
            <br>
            <br>Due to the fact that I needed to incorporate more information than I
              had previously planned for, I also decided to add more labels that
              helped with organization of the information such as the
              labels “Next Bus” and “Arriving In”.

            <br>During the process I faced many new challenges from figuring out how
              to avoid “divitus” and properly organizing the semantics of my code
              to figuring out how to create inline displays and other CSS basics. T
              hough I overcame these challenges and was able to create a finished
              product, I know there is much more to learn and more ways that I
              can revise this work.
            <br>In the end, this final prototype is a solution for the problem of a
              transit system expansion that has led to a complexity of usage for the
              users of the transit system. This final product provides a simple,
              organized, and accurate way for riders to know what the next arriving
              bus us, when it will be there, and how long they have to get to the bus stop.</p>
