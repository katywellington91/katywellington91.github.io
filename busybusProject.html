    <!-- Overview section-->
    <section id="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The scenario for this application is a large city transit system that
           recently underwent an expansion. This expansion has led to the addition
           of many new bus routes. While expansions can definitely lead to
           benefits, they can also lead to added complexity for the users. In
           this case, users were specifically complaining about stops that serve
           multiple bus lines.</p>
        <p>Picture this for a second: You are a user of this public transit
          system. You are walking towards your regular bus stop from which you
          commute to work. You are about a block away when you see a bus pull up.
          You hold your bag tight and run to the bus stop only to find out that… it is not your bus.
          This situation can be easily avoided with a mobile app that reliably and
          accurately gives the users information about the bus stops in this
          city transit system.</p>
        <p class="projectQuestions">Questions addressed by the app:</p>
        <p>Which bus line is arriving next?</p>
        <p>When will it arrive?</p>
        <p>How long does the user have to get to that stop?</p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <p>Public transit application are an integral part of the public transit
        system today. BusyBus allows users to more efficiently plan, not only
        their transit journeys, but their whole days by removing the ambiguity
        and confusion of when buses will arrive and at which bus stop locations.
        Users can look at specific stops and find out how long it will take them
        to get to that stop and which buses will be arriving there at specific times.</p>

    <!-- user research-->
    <section id="userResearch">
      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <h3 class="subtitle"> | Getting to Know the Users</h3>
      <p>I started by conducting both user surveys and user interviews. My user
        survey was completed by over 30 participants from all over the world.
        The survey asked them questions about their public transportation usage,
        their current and preferred ways to navigate their public transit systems,
        the applications they use (if any), and their preferences and usage of
        these apps as well as their pain points.I also chose 2 participants
        from the survey to interview. </p>
      <p>From the survey and interviews, I discovered that 70% of users feel
        that the most important feature on a public transit app is access to s
        chedule and times, 67% of users feel that there are aspects of inaccuracy
        in the current apps they use,  and 65% of users feel that their apps are
        in some way not user friendly.</p>
      <p>My most surprising discovery was that many people, though they may want
        to try a locally or regionally specific application, many switch to Google
        apps because other apps externalize information in the sense that different
        features have to be viewed in a different window, on a different website,
        or even in a completely different application.</p>

    <!-- competitive analysis-->
    <section id="competitiveAnalysis">
      <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
      <h3 class="subtitle"> | Scoping out the Market</h3>
      <p>In order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of other public
        transit apps as well as find the market opportunity for my BusyBus app,
        I completed a SWOT competitive analysis of Google Maps and RTD Denver.
        From the SWOT analysis, I found...</p>
      <p>The RTD app provides system maps and station information specific to
        Denver that Google Maps does not provide. However, this app’s weaknesses
        include an interface that is busy and confusing to navigate. RTD Denver
        also often provides inaccurate schedule and time information.</p>
      <p>Google Maps is globally known as a reliable navigation app for multiple
        modes of transportation including cars, buses, bikes, walking etc.  Google
        maps is also known for its accuracy and reliability in terms of journey
        times and distances. However, the weakness of Google Maps in this situation
        is that it does not provide bus stop specific information which is what
        was specifically asked for by users in this case study design brief.</p>
      <p>I discovered that the opportunity for my BusyBus app would be a locally
        specific, reliable and accurate transit app where users can find everything
        they need in one app. The BusyBus user interface would also need to be
        easy to be intuitive and easy to use in order to stay competitive in the
        category of transit applications.</p>

        by car because he does not have to worry about traffic or parking. He
        also uses public transit to get to the airport which he has to do often
        for business trips. Colin needs a transit app for the expanding public
        transit system to help him understand and use it. </p>

    <section id="concept">

      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <h3 class="subtitle"> | Color Palettes</h3>
      <p>I used colors to communicate and colors that would not conflict or
        distract from one another. I chose to use a blue to show when specific
        items or icons were clickable as well as to show connections between
        items chosen and new pages. I kept my color palette consistent throughout
        the different screens from the button colors, information colors, and
        background colors. I also made sure to avoid using colors that make it
        hard for people to perceive the content.</p>
      <p>Finally, I made sure, using the Contrast app from Apple, that my
        contrast ratios received an AA or AAA rating so that my app would provide
        optimal legibility for all users.</p>
      <img src="/images/colorpaletteBB.png" alt="Color Palettes">

      <h2>Concept</h2>
      <h3 class="subtitle"> | Typography</h3>
      <p>I used the typography guidelines outlined within the iOS resources
        created for Figma and cross referenced my choices with the Apple Human
        Interface Guidelines. I stuck to SF Pro Text or SF Pro Display for any
        text within my prototype. I used these fonts because the interface
        guidelines discussed how they can be used in a flexible manner at different
        sizes and weights while still maintaining legibility. I also used
        different sizes and weights to establish hierarchy of information.
        For example, I used font size 20 and bold style for titles. I also
        minimized the number of typefaces I used as per recommendation
        by the guidelines</p>

        participants of the usability tests, I created clear labels for the back
        buttons, and made sure that the map design was created in a way that
        clearly showed interactive aspects. This was done by placing familiar
        icons such as location icons. In creating this clickable prototype I also
        followed the iOS Human Interface Guidelines to maintain consistency

      <!-- Final Prototype-->
      <section id="finalPrototype">
        <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
        <h3> | Putting it All Together</h3>
        <p>My final step in creating this application was to code the final
          prototype. I used my knowledge of HTML and CSS to create the third screen
          of the visual prototype which lists the busses that arrive at a
          specific bus stop.</p>
        <p>For this final prototype, I was given more information that I needed
          to account for that I did not plan for in my original hi-fidelity
          mock-up design such as direction of travel, busses that were rerouted,
          and busses that were out of service. I made decisions in the creation
          of this final prototype so that it would maintain consistency with the
          visual design and the iOS human interface guidelines in terms of features
          such as space, typography, hierarchy, and color choice.</p>
        <p>Due to the fact that I needed to incorporate more information than I
          had previously planned for, I also decided to add more labels that
          helped with organization of the information such as the
          labels “Next Bus” and “Arriving In”.</p>
        <p>During the process I faced many new challenges from figuring out how
          to avoid “divitus” and properly organizing the semantics of my code
          to figuring out how to create inline displays and other CSS basics. T
          hough I overcame these challenges and was able to create a finished
          product, I know there is much more to learn and more ways that I
          can revise this work.</p>
        <p>In the end, this final prototype is a solution for the problem of a
          transit system expansion that has led to a complexity of usage for the
          users of the transit system. This final product provides a simple,
          organized, and accurate way for riders to know what the next arriving
          bus us, when it will be there, and how long they have to get to the bus stop.</p>
