      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p class="projectSubtitle">There is much room for improvement in the world of cloud storage tools
          made specifically for educators and educational purposes. Often, educators
          must rely on tools that were made for other purposes instead of platforms
          that meet their specific needs. The CloudEd application addresses this issue
          by providing an application specifically made to support the professional development of educators.
          This platform was created with a brand identity that encompasses the mission of helping educators
          more efficiently participate in the cycle of learning, growing, and
          implementing in the most productive way possible.</p>

      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <div>
        <p class="projectSubtitle">For this project, the client outlined the desire to explore the possibilities
        within the cloud storage and organization application market. The challenge to tackle was that,
        though there are already many big names within the cloud storage market, the market is
        still young and there is plenty of room for another platform as long as it has the right
        combination of in-demand features and targets a specific audience.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="solution">
      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <div>
        <p class="solutionSubtitle">Underserved audience with a need for a cloud storage application specifically tailored to them.</p>
        <p class="projectSubtitle">Educators go to many professional development experiences each year from after school,
          on campus meetings to nationally run conferences. At these workshops they are always given
          resources to help them continue their learning and implement what they have learned.
          However, these are often received in paper form or in Google Drive. An educator may not necessarily
          implement that specific idea or skill until months later and at that point the resource is hard to
          retrieve and the opportunity for growth is ended or becomes too time consuming or difficult for a teacher’s
          already packed schedule.</p>
        <p class="projectSubtitle">CloudEd cloud storage and organization platform makes valuable resources accessible and
          allows teachers to continue as professionals and grow in the art and science of teaching.<p>
        <p class="projectSubtitle">Through CloudEd, educators can also stay connected to other members of the development
          experience for collaboration and to grow a community of support.</p>

    <section class="userResearch">
      <h5>User Research | Getting to Know the Users</h5>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">I started my process by conducting user surveys to better understand
        which platforms were being used, what features users value and use frequently, and their pain points.</p>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">In connecting this back to the requests within the client brief,
        I was able to see that the client was correct in stating that sharing, uploading,
        creating and organizing content are all valuable and important features for users (as well as connecting with others)
        while saving content from the web was not a valued feature. This would help me in deciding which features to focus on.</p>

      <h5>Competitive Analysis | Market Scope</h5>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">To both understand the cloud storage market and to understand how to
        best position my cloud application ideas I conducted a competitive
        analysis of Google Drive, Pinterest, and Evernote. I chose these three
        applications because they are all applications that my survey respondents
        indicated that they use and they are distinct from one another in what
        they offer users. Evernote is a place for note taking, journaling, and organizing,
        Pinterest a place to browse for ideas and inspiration, and Google Drive
        is an all in one storage platform that  is well known for expanding the
        abilities of real time collaboration.</p>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">Google Drive’s biggest weaknesses include a cluttered interface with an unreliable search functionality.</p>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">Pinterest has issues with scams and spam as well as a perceived gender bias market.</p>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">Evernote has an interface that is not intuitive and pricey upgrades.</p>

        potential users. I used this information to create personas that would portray
        the different types of users that emerged from my research.</p>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">Their major distinctions lie in the potential use of the application for
        professional versus personal projects as well. Also, the family traveler
        persona has a stronger emphasis on documentation and creation of a narrative
        that will be created and then left alone while the teacher persona emphasizes
        an ongoing process of sharing, learning, and implementing the content found in the application.</p>

        Within these wireframes, I mapped out the onboarding process as well as creating and
        joining groups, uploading content, sharing content, and connecting with other group members.
        For both designs, I conducted both in person and remote usability tests and had the
        users complete 7 different tasks. It was an overall positive experience.</p>

        <p class="conceptSubtitle">Creating the moodboard helped me discover a meaningful color palette.
          The primary color choice involves a greenish blue, dark blue, and offwhite
          as the primary colors while having an ocher yellow and grayish blue as
          secondary colors. The greenish blue was chosen to combine the meaning of
          both blue and geen. Green signifies growth and development and brings energy
          with it. Blue signifies wisdom and learning and is calming. A blue-green combines
          the strengths of these colors. The darker blues ground the design and emphasizes
          the professionalism aspect of the brand. The ocher yellow adds energy and
          positivity to the platform. I also made sure, using the Contrast app from Apple, that my contrast ratios
          received an AA or AAA rating so that my app would provide optimal
          legibility for all users.</p>

        group of them shows collaboration. The final shape of the cloud signifies
        the cloud storage and organization capabilities of this program. However,
        the cloud also signifies another meaning- this program allows for a way to
        organize and keep track of resources in a simple way. It is what you need
        when your head is clouded by clutter and messiness. The ellipse signifies
        balance and positivity. It is balanced between two of the spirals and the
        yellow shade brings energy to the logo.</p>

      <h5>High-Fi Mock-Ups | Function & Identity</h5>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">I took the work I did with the functionality of the platform and combined
        it with the branding identity work to create my first hi-fidelity mockups.
        In order to make some important layout decisions, I conducted preference tests.</p>

    <!-- Usability Testing -->
    <section class="usabilitytesting">
      <h5>Usability Testing | Putting it to the Test</h5>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">I turned my high fidelity static mockups into a clickable prototype
        using InVision and conducted 3 remote and in person usability tests.</p>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">I had the users complete a series of tasks and also asked them questions
        specific to the branding. These tasks included…</p>
      <p class="task">1. Creating an account</p>
      <p class="task">2. Joining and creating groups</p>
      <p class="task">3. Uploading and creating content</p>
      <p class="task">4. Sharing content</p>
      <p class="task">5. Connecting with other member</p>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">The branding questions included opinion questions about layout of the
        platform and feelings evoked by it.</p>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">Within this usability test round, I found it very helpful to video each
        of the tests so that I could go back and closely analyze the feedback I received.</p>

      <h5>Usability Testing | Key Takeaways & Changes</h5>

      <div class="onboardingBoxes">
        <div class="onboardingBox1">
          <img class="testingImg" src="/images/onboarding.png" alt="Onboarding Process">
        </div>
        <div class="onboardingBox2">
          <span class="interfaceChangeTitle">The Onboarding Process</span>
          <p class="interfaceChangeSubtitle">I realized through the usability testing process that I needed to create
            a simpler onboarding process. The users made it evident to me that nobody
            wants to take a lot of steps to get originally set up. In reassessing the onboarding process,
            I was able ton condense the steps from 7 to 4.  I also streamlined the process by
            allowing users to skip steps they don’t feel is neccessary and also adding Google OAuth.
            This change aligned with my goal of avoiding the original recorded frustration of having
            to take too many steps to accomplish a task.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <span class="interfaceChange">Lots and lots of interface changes:</span>
      <p class="sectionSubtitle">1: Users wanted a symbol indicating which groups they are the administrator of.
        This was resolved by adding the word “creator” within the group box
        that the user was the creator of.

        <p class="sectionSubtitle">2: Based on user confusion during the tests, it became clear that there
        needed to be a clearer indication of which folder the user is in.

        <p class="sectionSubtitle">3: I originally thought that, in order to perform an action for a
        specific folder, the user would start with the list of folders. Based on
        the way in which users accomplished the “add collaborator to folder” task,
        it became clear that I needed to provide an alternative way for users to
        complete these tasks. I added an ellipse icon that lead to a dropdown menu.

        <p class="sectionSubtitle">4: In order to streamline the interface look, I moved the placement of
        the search bar instead of having it in multiple places which caused confusion
        of what the user was searching for.

        <p class="sectionSubtitle">5: This was a simple change! According to user feedback, I added indicators
        of who is you have shared the file with/ who is collaborating on it
        by adding a picture icon.

        <p class="sectionSubtitle">6: After many usability tests and impromptu user interviews about icon meaning,
        I came to the conclusion that I would be unable to find icons that meant the same thing
        to every user. Instead, I added hover labels indicating the meaning of the button so
        that the purpose of each button is clear!</p>
        <img class="interfaceImg" src="/images/interfacechanges1.png" alt="Interface Changes">

        <p class="sectionSubtitle">7: Based on user feedback, I added a place where user can see a list of other members.

        <p class="sectionSubtitle">8: In order to make sure that one of the most fundamental actions in this
          application was not confusing, I added access code subtext so that users
          would know where they can find the access code for a group they want to join.

        <p class="sectionSubtitle">9: Based on my observations of users’ initial navigation through the
          application interface, I realized that it would be easier for the user
          to understand the purpose of the context specific plus sign if I added a
          short tour to make the big plus sign more clear from the very beginning!

        <p class="sectionSubtitle">  10: The context specific button is one of the most important features of
          the application. I added further hints of how to use the context specific
          plus sign when a user is first setting up their dashboard.

          <p class="sectionSubtitle">11: Number twelve was a lesson in CONSISTENCY! I had originally labeled
          the group description as “course description”. User feedback that this
          inconsistency in labeling was confusing, “Were they part of a course or a group?”</p>

        <h5>Final Prototype | Putting it All Together</h5>
        <p class="sectionSubtitle">This process all led to the final prototype.</p>
        <p class="sectionSubtitle">This final prototype is a solution to the initial problems outlined in the
          client brief. It is a cloud storage application that can be distinct within
          the cloud storage application market and targets a specific audience that
          has been under-represented within this market.</p>
        <p class="sectionSubtitle">Based on the features desired by both the client and the users, this application
          allows people to share content, upload content, back up content, organize content,
          and continue communicating and collaborating with others.</p>

          I did not want to ignore this user need. I created a mobile app version
          for CloudEd. It is currently meant to be used for the purposes of viewing
          content within the groups the user is already a part of and joining new groups.
          It has the potential to evolve into an all encompassing app.</p>

            <p class="conclusionSubtitle conclusionSubtitleAlign"> • I learned how much a project can evolve from the beginning to the end.
              It was amazing to see how much this project changed from the first
              iteration to the last.</p>
            <p class="conclusionSubtitle conclusionSubtitleAlign"> • I learned the value of usability tests and how much a designer can
              learn from the perspective of a user, especially when they put their
              own perspective aside.</p>
            <p class="conclusionSubtitle conclusionSubtitleAlign"> • It was imperative that I learned about project organization quickly as
              this larger project had many different deliverables and not to
              mention the sheer quantity of mockup pngs!</p>

               I want to improve. I want to continue to learn from the primary
               users of this application about how to make it better, more effective,
               and more intuitive.</p>
            <p class="conclusionSubtitle conclusionSubtitleAlign"> • Transform from the MVP to the next level and include new ideas- at the end
              of the project I thought of a new idea- an image uploaded in which educators
              could upload an image of any resource that they created on paper since
              sometimes this is unavoidable in a group work setting.</p>
            <p class="conclusionSubtitle conclusionSubtitleAlign"> • I would like to continue developing the mobile app.
              Teachers work incredible hard to make sure the education they provide
              is accessible to all their students and I want to ensure that this app
              is accessible for all! I will continue to learn about and improve upon
              the accessibility components of this application.</p>
