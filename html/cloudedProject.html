      <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>There is much room for improvement in the world of cloud storage tools made specifically for educators and educational purposes. Often, educators must rely on tools that were made for other purposes instead of platforms that meet their specific needs. The CloudEd application addresses this issue by providing an application specifically made to support the professional development of educators. This platform was created with a brand identity that encompasses the mission of helping educators more efficiently participate in the cycle of learning, growing, and implementing in the most productive way possible.</p>

    <section class="problem">
      <h5>Problem</h5>
      <p>For this project, the client outlined the desire to explore the possibilities within the cloud storage and organization application market. The challenge to tackle was that, though there are already many big names within the cloud storage market, the market is still young and there is plenty of room for another platform as long as it has the right combination of in-demand features and targets a specific audience.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="solution">
      <h5>Solution</h5>
      <p>Underserved audience with a need for a cloud storage application specifically tailored to them.</p>
      <p>Educators go to many professional development experiences each year from after school, on campus meetings to nationally run conferences. At these workshops they are always given resources to help them continue their learning and implement what they have learned. However, these are often received in paper form or in Google Drive. An educator may not necessarily implement that specific idea or skill until months later and at that point the resource is hard to retrieve and the opportunity for growth is ended or becomes too time consuming or difficult for a teacherâ€™s already packed schedule.</p>
      <p>CloudEd cloud storage and organization platform makes valuable resources accessible and allows teachers to continue as professionals and grow in the art and science of teaching.<p>
      <p>Through CloudEd, educators can also stay connected to other members of the development experience for collaboration and to grow a community of support.</p>
